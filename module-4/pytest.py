Running pytest

This is the command that has to be executed on the Terminal prompt:

python3 -m pytest test_file.py

Alternative method

py.test will look for the keyword test and run the tests over those files and functions automatically.

py.test test_file.py

When you run pytest for a specific function add     ::    to run a specific function in a given file.
